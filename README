# Patch to make message id and boundary compliant with RFC 2392
# and to encode headers correctly
#
#======================================================================

Because the boundary is identical with the first part of the message
id, some securiy systems mark mails sent by SQL-Ledger as spam. This
patch constructs them in a different way. Suggested by Marcus Schopen.

Secondly, the patch corrects the encoding of the mail headers; until
now, special characters in headers weren't encoded at all and backup
mails encoded in Latin-1 instead of the actual character set.
